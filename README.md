## Aluminum Toxicity Project
I worked on the interaction of aluminum ions with lipid bilayer membranes to explore potential mechanisms of metal toxicity in marine organisms. For this purpose, I built lipid bilayers using CHARMM-GUI and memgen, optimized their structures and simulated them in Desmond to evaluate ion-membrane interactions both in the presence and absence of ion channels. Performing these studies helped me improve my knowledge of force-field theory, molecular dynamics, free-energy landscapes and membrane biophysics
